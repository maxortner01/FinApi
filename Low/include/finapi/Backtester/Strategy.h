     * @brief An abstract base class providing an interface for all subsequent
     *        strategy handling objects.
     * 
     *        The goal of a derived Strategy object is to generate Signal objects
     *        for particular symbols based on the input of Bars (OLHCVI) generated
     *        by a DataHandler object.
     * 
     *        This is designed to work both with historic and live data as the 
     *        Strategy object is agnostic to the data source, since it obtains the
     *        bar from a queue object.
